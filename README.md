# Interactive Wormholes

This is an addon for the popular MMORPG "World of Warcraft".  
It can be downloaded at [Curse](//mods.curse.com/addons/wow/interactivewormholes) or at [WoWInterface](//wowinterface.com/downloads/info24119).

## Description

When using engineering wormholes such as [Wormhole Generator: Northrend](//wowhead.com/item=48933) you'd normally get a list of (sometimes obfuscated) destinations.

Instead of that, *Interactive Wormholes* displays these destinations as clickable portals on your world map.

Supported "wormholes":

- [Wormhole Generator: Northrend](http://www.wowhead.com/item=48933/wormhole-generator-northrend)
- [Wormhole Centrifuge](http://www.wowhead.com/item=112059/wormhole-centrifuge)
- [Reaves](http://www.wowhead.com/item=132523/reaves-battery) [Wormhole Generator module](http://www.wowhead.com/item=132524/reaves-module-wormhole-generator-mode)
- [Vethir](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=108685/vethir) in Stormheim
