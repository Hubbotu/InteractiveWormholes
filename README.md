# Interactive Wormholes

This is an addon for the popular MMORPG "World of Warcraft".
It can be downloaded at [Curse](//mods.curse.com/addons/wow/interactivewormholes) or at [WoWInterface](//wowinterface.com/downloads/info24119).

## Description

When using engineering wormholes such as [Wormhole Generator: Northrend](//wowhead.com/item=48933) and [Wormhole Centrifuge](//wowhead.com/item=112059) you'd normally get a list of (sometimes obfuscated) destinations.

Instead of that, *Interactive Wormholes* displays these destinations as clickable portals on your world map.
